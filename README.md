# CGS-ProfileX

A full-stack web application built with **React (Vite)**, **Node.js (Express)**, and **MongoDB**, developed by **Neelabh Priyam Jha** as part of the **CGS (IIT KGP) 2025 Sophomore Selection Task** for the **WebX Track**.

I am attempting **both the Frontend and Backend tracks** for this task.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Overview

CGS-ProfileX is designed as a profile dashboard application where users interact with server-driven APIs to manage and display data. The frontend is a React SPA served via Nginx, the backend is a Node.js + Express server with MongoDB (Atlas) integration and this README is written by ChatGPT.

> ⚠️ The client app depends entirely on APIs from the backend — it cannot function as a standalone frontend.
